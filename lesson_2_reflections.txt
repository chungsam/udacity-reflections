How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- The staging area allows you to be specific about the files that you've changed that you want to commit
- It allows you to separate the commits according to the logical changes that you've made


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- You can just add the files that contain the logical change you want to commit
- You can "group" files into commits that represent the logical change you want to commit


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
- It would allow you to keep track of work that you might do on the master file, but separate it from work that you might do on another more experimental branch


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
- It shows the master branch and other branches
- It shows unreachable branches, and which branches mave been merged

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
- When you merge two branches together, it combines all the changes from both branches into a single branch
- You still have access to the parents of each branch, but you have to perform diff differently, using git show
