When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- If you have more than one machine that you develop on
- If you're collaborating with multiple people
- To make sure you have a "backup" in the cloud in case something happens to your computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Sometimes you may working on something you haven't quite finished yet, which doesn't add up to be a full single "logical change"
- You can have full control over which changes get "grouped" into a particular commit, and which files should be part of that commit
